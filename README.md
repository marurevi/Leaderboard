# Leaderboard: Setup Project

> The leaderboard website displays scores submitted by different players. It also allows you to submit your score. All data is preserved thanks to the external Leaderboard API service.

![leaderboard_wireframe](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92180054/167676270-71206b20-8056-430b-a772-072bff20320f.png)

> In this activity you will set up a JavaScript project for the Leaderboard list app, using webpack and ES6 features, notably modules. You should develop a first working version of the app following a wireframe, but without styling - just focus on functionality. In following activities, you will consume the Leaderboard API using JavaScript async and await and add some styling.
